*"Engineering is not merely knowing and being knowledgeable; engineering is not merely analysis; engineering is not merely the possession of the capacity to get elegant solutions to non-existent engineering problems. Engineering is practicing the art of the organized forcing of technological change." - Gordon Brown*
